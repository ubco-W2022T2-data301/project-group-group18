## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{We are exploring this dataset to bring transparency to how vital people think education is and to see if old social misconstructs still exist and their severity. Since literacy is a vital part of one's upbringing, it is essential to know how socioeconomic factors affect literacy and how it has changed over the years, hopefully positively. Furthermore, by examining the historical trends in literacy rates, we can better understand how education has evolved over time and the factors that have contributed to these changes. By identifying these issues, we can work towards dismantling them and creating a more equitable and just society for all individuals. We are interested in this topic and dataset because education and literacy have become a significant part of everyday life. We want to see how opinions and attitudes towards literacy have changed due to minor or major changes in this dataset. The interest comes from how many more children are able to participate in a society that wants you to have the education to be a part of the roundtable.}

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{This dataset is on youth literacy rates. It covers various factors that play into the literacy rate of youths, such as wealth, gender, and location. The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) collected data between 1996 and 2019. This organization is devoted to collecting data from around the world to find out the gaps in education internationally. It gathered its data from the ministry of education of that country or the national statistics office. For us, the purpose of this dataset was essential to see if there was a trend in the literacy rate of youths. For example, are more young women seeking education than before? Has there been a change in the mentality of individuals in underdeveloped countries regarding literacy? Questions like these can provide valuable insight into the future of education around the globe and what actions could be taken to boost literacy levels.}
