# **Literacy Rates**
## Exploratory Data Analysis


## How has the gender gap in literacy changed?
To evaluate if there is a gender gap when it comes to literacy rates, the analysis was done using factors that are known to affect literacy rates such as wealth, religion, and the levels of education completed. These factors were answered using subquestions.

#### **Concerning certain regions, which gender is known to have a higher literacy rate?**

This graph was analysing the literacy rate based on the completion of school. In this graph, we were able to analyse the spread of data and the common percentage of those who completed each level of education. It was split according to gender to determine if there was gap in the attendance of a certain gender. The conclusion when it came to this was that there were no wide gaps in certain regions. However, the attendance of females dropped in certain regions such as Central and Southern Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa.

#### **Does religion play a role in the literacy rate? Is there a particular gender that is more educated?**

When comparing the literacy rates of different religions, some, such Seventh-Day Adventists, Zionists, Christians, etc., come into the category of having a high literacy rate. While the literacy rates of some religions vary greatly, the majority of them, like Traditional/Animist, lie within the lower range. In accordance with the plot, there are discrepancies in the rates of literacy for men and women according to various religions. Our statistics on Muslims, for example, show that while female literacy rates varied from 0% to 100%, a larger percentage of Muslim women fell between the ranges of 80% and 100%. The literacy rate among Muslim men ranged from 60% to 80%. The aforementioned plotÂ leads us to the conclusion that it is impossible to determine for sure if there are factors that cause religion to have a direct impact on the literacy rate.

#### **What is the effect of wealth on literacy rate among a particular gender?**

Looking at all these quintiles, which range from the poorest to the richest, it is clear that women often have a lower literacy rate than men. Over the years, for the first three quintiles, the female literacy drops significantly in 2016 as compared to 2014 which seemed to have the high female literacy rate.
The females literacy rate might be much lower in the quintile 1 and quintile 2 because of societal factors such as the belief the woman should work at home and take care of the household or the idea that women should take up more nurturing roles where education might not be needed. Quintile 4 and Quintile 5 has a higher literacy rate for the women.

In general, when answering the question on the gender gap in the literacy rates. There is a gender gap in literacy rates. In certain regions of this world, it is not a wide gap. However, it was found out that men take the lead in a lot of factors concerning literacy rates.
